   # AI Social Listener

   ## Overview

   *AI Social Listener* is a tool designed to automatically collect, analyze, and interpret sentiment around brand-related content across social media platforms. This tool integrates AI models to assess the sentiment of social media posts (positive, negative, or neutral) and tracks emerging trends, helping companies and individuals gain insights into public opinion, detect trends, and manage their online reputation effectively.

   ## Problem Statement

   With the rapid growth of social media platforms, the volume of user-generated content increases exponentially across platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc. The challenge lies in effectively gathering and analyzing this vast amount of unstructured data to understand user sentiment, track trending topics, and detect misinformation. This is critical for businesses to stay competitive in real-time market analysis and marketing strategies.

   ## Solution

   The *AI Social Listener* will automatically collect data from popular social media platforms using the n8n automation tool and APIs. It will then use advanced AI models to analyze posts' sentiment, categorize content, and identify trending topics. The processed data will be presented in an intuitive web dashboard, helping users stay on top of social trends and brand perception.

   ### Key Features
   - *Data Collection*: Automatically gathers posts from various social media platforms using n8n and APIs.
   - *Sentiment Analysis*: Uses AI to classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - *Trend Detection*: Identifies emerging trends based on the frequency and sentiment of posts.
   - *Customizable Dashboard*: Visualizes data through charts and graphs, with filtering capabilities by topic, sentiment, and time.
   - *Real-Time Notifications*: Alerts users when new trends or significant changes occur.

   ## Technologies Used

   - *n8n*: For automating data collection via APIs.
   - *Puppeteer/Selenium*: For web scraping in case API access is limited.
   - *Google Gemini*: AI model for sentiment and topic analysis.
   - *ReactJS*: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
   - *ExpressJS*: Backend framework.
   - *MongoDB*: Database for storing collected data.
   - *Web Unlocker (Bright Data)*: Overcomes CAPTCHA and proxy challenges for data scraping.

   ## Methodology

   - *Data Collection*: The tool uses n8n to collect data from social media APIs, or scrapes data using Puppeteer/Selenium when APIs are restricted.
   - *Data Analysis*: Sentiment analysis and topic categorization are performed using advanced AI models like Google Gemini.
   - *Dashboard*: A web-based interface shows the analysis results through easy-to-read visualizations.
   - *Testing*: Cross-validation (k-fold) will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

   ## Target Users

   - *Businesses*: Companies seeking insights on customer sentiment, market trends, and competitor analysis.
   - *Individuals*: Social media influencers and content creators who wish to monitor the impact of their brand or content.
   - *Marketers*: Those who want to use social media data to shape their marketing strategies.

   ## Project Phases

   1. *Market Research & Analysis*: Understand user needs and competitor tools.
   2. *AI Model Training*: Develop and train sentiment analysis and trend detection models.
   3. *Platform Development*: Build data collection and processing pipelines, and create the web dashboard.
   4. *Testing & Optimization*: Perform system testing to ensure accuracy and responsiveness.
   5. *Beta Testing*: Conduct trials with small user groups to gather feedback.
   6. *Launch*: Finalize the application and release it for broader use.

   ## Feasibility

   This project leverages AI, automation, and data scraping technologies to offer a scalable solution for monitoring social media. The integration of these technologies allows the product to function seamlessly across a wide variety of platforms with minimal manual intervention.

   ## Potential Impact

   This tool will provide valuable insights for businesses, influencers, and marketers, allowing them to better understand public sentiment and react quickly to emerging trends. It will also help in identifying false or misleading content and filtering noise from valuable data, significantly reducing time and resource investments.
